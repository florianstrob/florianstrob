                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Florian Strob is an architectural historian, writer, and curator. His particular interests lie in modern and contemporary architecture and theory starting in the interwar period, modernist urbanism and its consideration in the context of climate change, as well as the history and reception of the Bauhaus school. In his research and curatorial projects, he has brought transdisciplinary and digital humanities approaches to architecture and its historiography. 
                        His curatorial practice is based on a critical approach towards the legacy of modernity. From 2018 to 2022, he was curator and head of the Bauhaus Residency, a program that invites contemporary artists to live and work in the Dessau Masters' Houses. Exhibitions with new works by artists, architects and writers such as Inge Mahn, Sofia Dona and Sujata Bhatt introduced female, queer and non-European voices into the context of the Bauhaus. He was also the curator for the UNESCO World Heritage sites of the Bauhaus Building and the Masters’ Houses in Dessau for the the Bauhaus centenary 2019.
                        His most recent books include "Architect of Letters. Reading Hilberseimer" (Bauwelt Fundamente, Birkhäuser 2022), "Linke Waffe Kunst. Die kommunistische Studentenfraktion am Bauhaus", edited together with Wolfgang Thöner and Andreas Schätzke (Bauwelt Fundamente, Birkhäuser 2022), and together with the photographer Thomas Meyer "Bauhaus Dessau Architektur" (Hirmer 2019), translated into English and Italian and awarded with the German Photo Book Award 2019/2020 (Silver). A critical edition of Ludwig Hilberseimer’s seminal book "The New City. Principles of Planning" is forthcoming (Spector Books, 2023).
                        He holds a Bachelor’s degree in architecture from TU Berlin, and a Master of Studies and PhD in Medieval and Modern Languages from the University of Oxford. 
                        He is currently research associate in the collections department of the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation, Germany.
